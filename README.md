# filmSale

This is a PHP/MySQL application that allows registered users to purchase film products.

The project has 3 major structures namely:

1. Database folder: which contains the SQL queries to create the database as well as the needed tables),

2. Funtions folder: which has the config.php file (to connect to the database) and queries.php(which caontians the sql queries to retrieve the necessary data from the database),

3. The last part of the project structure has the 'index.php' file which serves as the entry point for the application. Moreover, it serves to display the data required from the database;

The project implemented functional programming throughout to ensure the 'DRY' principle and to ensure clean and optimized codes.
